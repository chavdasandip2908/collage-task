			<p>

				life to spare time to work at the family owned Tea Stall as the family struggled to make ends meet.<br>☛ His
				school friends remember that as a child also he was very industrious and had an affinity for debates and
				a curiosity to read books.<br>☛ Schoolmates recollect how Mr. Modi used to spend many hours reading in the
				local Library. As a child he was also fond of swimming. <br><br>

				☛Mr. Modi’s thoughts and dreams as a child were quite removed from how most children of his age thought.<br>☛
				Perhaps it was the influence of Vadnagar which once used to be a vibrant center of Buddhist learning and
				spirituality many centuries ago.<br>☛ As a child also he always felt a strong urge to make a difference to
				society.<br>☛ He was highly influenced by the works of Swami Vivekananda which laid the foundation of his
				journey towards spiritualism and which inspired him to pursue the mission to fulfill Swamiji’s dream of
				making India a Jagat Guru. <br><br>

				☛At the age of 17 he left home to travel across India.<br>☛ For two years he travelled across the expansive
				landscape of India exploring various cultures.<br>☛ When he returned home he was a changed man with a clear
				aim of what he wanted to achieve in life. <br>☛He went to Ahmedabad and joined Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh

				Years in Governance
			</h1>

			<p>
				☛Narendra Modi’s evolution from quintessential Organization Man of the BJP to one of India’s best known leaders recognized for his Good Governance over a span of a decade tells a story of grit, determination and Strong Leadership in the face of grave adversity.<br>☛ Narendra Modi’s transition from the world of Political Organizing to the realm of Administration and Governance neither had the luxury of time nor the benefit of training. <br>☛Shri Modi had to learn the ropes of Administration while on the job right from Day One.<br>☛ Narendra Modi’s first 100 days in office offer a glimpse of not just how Shri Modi made that personal transition but these 100 days also offer a glimpse of how Shri Modi brought unconventional thinking and out of the box ideas to shake status-quo and reform Governance. <br><br>

				☛Narendra Modi’s path to creating a Vibrant Gujarat as a shining example of Development and Governance did not come easy.<br>☛ It was a path littered with adversities and challenges.<br>☛ Through the last decade if there is one constant trait of Narendra Modi that has stood out it is his Strong Leadership in the face of grave adversity.<br>☛ Shri Narendra Modi’s approach to governance has always been viewed as being above politics.<br>☛ Shri Modi never let political differences get in the way of pursuing solutions to developmental challenges. <br>☛As Shri Narendra Modi prepares to assume Office as India’s next Prime Minister, his approach to Administration and Governance stands out for its convergent thinking. <br>☛ The finest manifestation of Shri Modi’s philosophy of “Minimum Government, Maximum Governance” is his Pancha-Amrut construct for convergent Governance. <br><br>

				☛His performance is reflected in the many Awards his government received from both National and International media. <br>☛ Shri Narendra Modi as India’s Prime Minister brings with him a rich and hands-on experience as one of India’s most successful Chief Ministers and one of its finest of Administrators. <br><br>
